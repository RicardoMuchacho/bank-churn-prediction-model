Predicting Customer Churn in Banking - TFM Project

Summary

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning techniques. 
By analyzing customer demographics, account information, and transaction data, the objective is to identify clients at risk of leaving the bank. 
The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, baseline modeling, and incremental improvements using algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. 
Cross-validation ensures robust evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning is automated using tools like GridSearchCV.

Evaluation metrics such as AUC, Accuracy, and MAE are carefully selected and justified based on the business context. 
This approach provides actionable insights for retention strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn.
